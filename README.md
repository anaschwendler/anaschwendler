### Olar ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Ana](anaschwendler.com), Brazilian living in Berlin now, and as a developer, I hold a bachelor in Computer Science since February 2017, and I see my role in this world as bringing more diversity to the area (to change the way my university classes used to look like), and also contribute to open source (to give back the amount of help I've received throughout the years).

On this page, you might see lots of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) code (and now some sprinkles of Golang!), since I like to walk around both languages, but still, I'm not that attached to any of them, mostly open to learning something new. Saying that my best skill by this time is Backend Development, and my current interest is Developer Operations(DevOps) and infrastructure/scaling subjects.

Feel to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anaschwendler), or any other platform you might see my contact o/

Also, I always like to use gifs to express the way I'm feeling, so here it goes my general representation:
